I'm a software engineer & aspiring researcher interested in computer architecture,
embedded systems, and programming languages. I am currently working on
[Calyx](https://calyxir.org/) with the [Capra group](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/)
at Cornell.

I have previously interned at [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) and will be
returning there late Summer 2024. Prior to  starting school
I was a Drill Instructor in the Israeli Air Defense Command.
