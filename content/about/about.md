I'm currently a software engineer at Netflix where I work on
[unifying data models][UDA] by modeling with [RDF graphs].
Previously, I worked on tools for automating migrations, like Netflix's
recent [shift][aurora-migration] to Amazon Aurora. I also interned on
the Growth Engineering team to deliver backend functionality
to a variety of downstream services in the name of enabling
customer retention.

I graduated from Cornell University in 2024 with a Bachelors in computer science
and a minor in electrical and computer engineering. There I spent time researching
programming languages, computer architecture, and hardware-software interfaces
through work on [Calyx] with the [Capra group][Capra], mentored by
[Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) and
[Rachit Nigam](https://rachit.pl/).

Prior to  starting school I was an Air Defense Operator ("Interceptor") and
eventually a Drill Instructor in the Israeli Air Defense Command.

I hope to eventually continue my studies with a graduate degree. Please reach out
if you are interested in any of my [work](../projects).
